## Come and visit us

Open mornings are the best opportunity for you to see the school in action and to have your questions answered. If you are unable to attend the open morning, we will try to arrange an individual visit to the school. All families resident in Sao Paulo who are applying for a place at St. Paul's are expected to have visited the school as part of the admissions process.

The Open Morning sessions are primarily intended for Pre-Prep 1 parents. Children who were born between 1st July 2021 and 30th June 2023 are eligible to apply for entry in the academic year 2026-27. Please note that applications for the year 2025-24 are now closed.

If your child is a Pre-Prep 1 applicant for 2027, we recommend that you visit our website in a few months time to book your visit.

If you are interested in applying for other year groups, you are more than welcome to participate, but please note that places beyond Pre-Prep 1 are limited and dependent on current pupils' departure.

We kindly ask international families considering moving to Sao Paulo to fill out the [International families contact form](/fs/pages/498) so that our Admissions team can contact you.

This form requires Javascript to be enabled for submission and authorization.
