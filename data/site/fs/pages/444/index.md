## Open mornings - next sessions

We host a number of open events for prospective families interested in the school. This a good time to see the school in action and meet our students and staff.

Should you wish to visit the school, please fill in our form below and a member of our team will contact you with an available date.

The Open Morning sessions are primarily intended for Pre-Prep 1 parents. Children who were born between 1st July 2022 and 30th June 2023 are eligible to apply for entry in the academic year 2026-27. **Please note that applications for the year 2025-26  are now closed. **

If your child is a Pre-Prep 1 applicant for 2027 onwards, we recommend that you visit our website in a few months time to book your visit.

If you are interested in applying for other year groups, you are more than welcome to participate, but please note that places beyond Pre-Prep 1 are limited and dependent on current pupils' departure.
