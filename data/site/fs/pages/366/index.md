> Welcome to the Senior School at St. Paul’s, where we promote a stimulating, supportive and competitive academic environment where we focus on understanding our identity as global citizens.

With a team of highly specialised and qualified teaching professionals, Senior School offers a wealth of academic and extracurricular activities. Small classes, taught in modern, bright and well-equipped classrooms with interactive whiteboards, stimulate collaborative learning.

As pupils progress through Senior School they will discover that they have more choices (for example option subjects at IGCSE (International General Certificate of Secondary Education) and IB (International Baccalaureate)). They also have more opportunities to take leadership roles and to develop responsibility within the enrichment programme. The oldest pupils have the chance to become prefects, our team of pupil leaders. They are also able to initiate new ideas and change through the school council and through our extensive programme of clubs and societies, many of which are run by the pupils themselves.

We expect Senior School pupils to participate fully in the school’s academic life. St. Paul’s is a busy, thriving environment where every child’s interests are not just catered for, but cared for. As a result, our pupils not only perform well in their public exams but understand the opportunities that are available if they are prepared to meet the challenge. 

Martina Oparaocha, Head of Senior School
