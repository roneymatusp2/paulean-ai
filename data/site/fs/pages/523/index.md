**St. Paul's Bursary Fund for UK families**

As a British School, we have created a special Bursary Fund to support UK families wanting a first-class British education for their children, but are unable to cover the full cost of the fees at St. Paul's. Please fill in this form to start your child's application process. If you have any queries, please contact us at admissionsstp@stpauls.br. 

Please note that in order to move forward with this process, families will be asked to send us proof of residence in the UK (past or present).
