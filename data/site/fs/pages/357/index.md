For all year groups we accept applications from pupils regardless of their religion, race, sex or nationality, provided that there are openings available. We are a school which strives to offer equal opportunities for all.  All applications to the school are considered with care, aiming at accommodating the families' wishes with the available places. Decisions concerning admissions are made by a committee of teachers and senior leaders appointed by the Headmaster, also bearing in mind the following:

  * International pupils moving to the city 
  * Family connections to the United Kingdom or engaged with the British community in Sao Paulo
  * Children with siblings already attending St. Paul's School 
  * Academic ability , readiness for school as well as ability to study in English and access the school curriculum in a meaningful way
  * Alignment with the community and shared values of the school, its approach to education and with modern British social and educational attitudes



## Which school, which year? 

The admissions process will differ according to the year group you are applying for entry into. Please, check here which year group your child would be eligible for.

***Upper Sixth - IB** | **3 ª serie do Ensino Medio** | **Year 13** | **12th Grade**  
  
*Please note that as the IGCSE and IB Diploma are two-year courses, pupils should start them at the beginning of each cycle (Form 4 for the IGCSE and Lower Sixth for the IB). We therefore do not have entry points in Form 5 and the Upper Sixth. Pupils arriving from schools that follow the southern hemisphere academic year will need to repeat six months of their studies in order to be able to enter into the northern hemisphere academic year that we follow (whereby the beginning of the academic year is in August). Occasionally there are exceptions to our standard admissions procedures which the school deals with on an individual basis as appropriate in each case.
