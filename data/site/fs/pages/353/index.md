The St. Paul's curriculum is aligned with the [English National Curriculum](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-curriculum) incorporating the [UK National Curriculum](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-curriculum), [Cambridge IGCSEs](https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/programmes-and-qualifications/cambridge-upper-secondary/cambridge-igcse/curriculum/) and the [International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme](https://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/). We also incorporate the requirements laid out by the [Brazilian Core Curriculum](http://portal.mec.gov.br/).  

Every pupil is inspired to take advantage of the variety of [enrichment opportunities](/fs/pages/367) available and venture beyond the boundaries of academic curriculum to understand the wider world around them. We offer many artistic, cultural and sporting  activities, field trips that enhance learning experiences.  

We also contribute to the development of each pupil's sense of identity by helping them to understand the spiritual, moral, social and cultural aspects of our diverse society. Pauleans are acutely aware of the local, national and global dimensions of their lives. 

A British bilingual and bicultural education 

St. Paul's School integrates elements of Brazilian education into the curriculum: the Escola Infantil, Ensino Fundamental and Ensino Medio. Qualified local teachers, fully registered with the [Brazilian Ministry of Education (MEC)](https://www.gov.br/mec/pt-br), are part of the school's teaching staff.
