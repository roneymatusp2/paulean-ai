# St. Paul's values

At St. Paul's, we believe in releasing passion to achieve the best in everyone. We should strive to be better in all that we do, in work and play, every day. An innovative, structured curriculum, combined with excellent teaching, state of the art facilities, and the best in pastoral care, equip pupils to achieve that.  

Our culturally diverse community of pupils of over thirty nationalities includes girls and boys aged 3 to 18. As members of a strong and united community, Pauleans are equipped with everything they need to be global citizens that make a difference. Our mission is to provide a high quality British and Brazilian education for the personal and academic development of pupils within a framework of a caring and united community. 

**In this, they are sustained by our six Core Values: Aspiration, Adventure,  Responsibility, Resilience, Inclusion and - above all - Kindness. **

Our values shine through in our pupils, and we are very proud of all that they achieve, whether that is on the stage in the theatre, on the sports field, in their music making, in their community service activities or, indeed, in their academic studies.  

## Our values

Kindness 

Kindness stands foremost as our most important value. St. Paul's is a school but it is also a family for life those lucky enough to join as pupils, parents or staff. This community is sustained by compassion, care and respect for all. Kindness lies at the heart of our nurturing pastoral ethos and puts the interests of the child at the heart of all that we do. 

Resilience 

In nurturing the best from our pupils, we understand that learning to cope with challenges and setbacks is key to leading happy and fulfilled lives. St. Paul's is a safe and supportive community where pupils are stretched, challenged, encouraged and recognised for their efforts. 

 

Responsibility 

The outstanding St Paul's education bestows many advantages upon pupils but also instils within them with a sense of responsibility, duty and service. As they prepare for life beyond school, they learn to value their social obligations to their families and peers, their communities, their country and to the world. 

Inclusion 

We celebrate our identity as a progressive, innovative, all-ability school that welcomes all talents, cultures and backgrounds. Pauleans are many things, but most of all they are themselves and we work with our staff and parents to ensure their children become the very best they can be within our caring, inclusive and tolerant community. 

 

Adventure 

Childhood should be an adventure and, even as adults, we must never forget the wonder of new discoveries and the thrill of going beyond our perceived limits. Our young people are challenged and engaged both within the classroom and beyond and, through adventure, learn much about themselves and the world around them. 

 

Aspiration 

Pauleans aspire to be the best we can be in our work, relationships and in life. Aspiration is released through outstanding teaching, exciting learning, holistic enrichment and supportive pastoral care. Our pupils achieve astonishing academic success and go on to top universities around the world. Thereafter, they enjoy happy and fulfilled lives whilst remaining true to the high values of the school.
