St. Paul's pupils and staff benefit from both its robust historical roots and its modern British atmosphere. The school is based in the aptly-named leafy residential district of Jardins, in Sao Paulo. We seek excellence and modern approaches in everything we do, and these qualities are clearly reflected in the services and facilities we offer.  

The school has undertaken an almost continuous programme of building works on its site over the past quarter century as it has steadily grown. This has included the extensive refurbishment and extension of the original school building, a new sports centre, the creation of a Sixth Form centre, a new learning resources centre, and the full refurbishment of the Pre- Prep School area. Looking ahead, we have embarked on further ambitious plans which include the complete redesign of the Prep School, the creation of an Outdoor Centre, and the development a state-of-the-art on-site Innovation Centre.

## Working in Sao Paulo

More than 20 million people live in Sao Paulo's metropolitan area. It is Brazil's largest city and the world's fourth largest city. Unsurprisingly, modern life in Sao Paulo comes with all the pros and cons associated with a mega-city.

Sao Paulo is often referred to as Brazil's growth engine, as it alone accounts for almost 34% of the country's gross domestic product. Its economic success is a key reason why working in Sao Paulo is so attractive for expatriates.

The urban lifestyle has much to offer: a vibrant local culture, entertainment and leisure, shopping facilities and - last but not least - exciting business opportunities. As a lively metropolis, Sao Paulo abounds in cultural events and entertainment opportunities. The city is home to many museums, including the renowned _Museu de Arte de S ao Paulo_ (MASP), as well as dozens of theatres.

On the downside, air pollution, [social deprivation] and heavy traffic flow are also part of daily life in the city. Generally speaking, most expatriates who have chosen to live in Sao Paulo over the years have come to love their new home.
