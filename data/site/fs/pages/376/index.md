The St. Paul's Centenary interviews have started 

Feb 28 2024

To rebuild our timeline precisely, we are digging into the Paulean's historical files and searching about the important events which are fundamental for our history, such as the British immigration to Brazil.

Simonica Erler von Erlea, class of 1980 

Aug 22 2023

_First as a pupil and then as a mother, Simonica  's life has been always connected to our school. Being a European family, the Erler von Erleas were looking for an international school which would match their expectations about a complete curriculum, what made St. Paul's School their choice. Happily, the Paulean spirit was cultivated and keeps growing among the family, bringing the next generation to our classrooms as well. _

Dra Silvia Siqueira and a legacy as Diretora Oficial

Silvia Fortes Siqueira is one of those St. Paul's community members who will always be in our memories. PhD in Bilingual Education, she has been the Diretora Oficial of the school for 21 years, making all of our pupils' work and achievements be recognised in Brazil. Together with the Brazilian Secretaries team, Silvia led important projects during her Paulean journey, such as the insertion of one additional year in the Ensino Fundamental, other curriculum adjustments, and the implementation of the new Ensino Medio.
