# Welcome to St. Paul's

> A warm welcome to St. Paul's.
> 
> As we approach a hundred years of educational excellence in Sao Paulo, St. Paul's is a school with eyes on the future.

We draw on our proud heritage, traditions and values as a world class overseas British school, the first in Latin America to be recognised as such by the UK government, yet we look forward with imagination and confidence.

_Mr Titus Edge, St. Paul 's Headmaster_

With our Anglo-Brazilian curriculum, we embrace the very best of both cultures. Our strong set of shared values lie at the heart of the school, shaping the experience that our pupils enjoy.  We are an all ability, family school, which welcomes boys and girls, aged 3 to 18. They are all finding their way on their exciting learning journey, brilliantly supported by dedicated staff and the school community of parents and Old Pauleans.

Pauleans are many things but most of all they are themselves. It is our aim to discover the passion and talents of every pupil. Academic rigour, empathetic pastoral care and a range of broader curricular experiences help to inspire and nurture our pupils as confident, compassionate young people, possessing the integrity and resilience to thrive in an uncertain world.

Our commitment to broad educational experiences opens a multitude of opportunities to Pauleans who go on to leading universities in the United Kingdom, America and Brazil.

I hope that you find our website helpful. Please do contact us for a visit if you would like to know more. I look forward to meeting you and I know you will enjoy meeting our boys and girls and hearing from them about what they love about being a Paulean.

_Mr Titus Edge, St. Paul 's Headmaster_

## Our facilities

Pupils at St. Paul's School benefit from both its rich history and its innovative, modern facilities. The school is situated in the leafy residential area aptly named Jardins, in Sao Paulo. We seek excellence and modernity in all contexts, and this is clearly reflected in the services and spaces we offer.  

The site has undertaken an almost continuous programme of building works over the past 25 years as it has gradually grown. This includes extensive refurbishment and extension of the original school building and also the Junior School area.  In 2014 we inaugurated a multimillion dollar underground state of the art sports centre including basketball and volleyball courts, and a full-size heated swimming pool. In 2016 we celebrated 90 years of excellent education by opening the Queen Elizabeth II Academic Centre, which houses a learning resources centre, art studios, music school with the latest recording facilities, and 10 modern science laboratories. 

Looking ahead, we have embarked on ambitious plans which include the creation of an Outdoor Centre and the development a state-of-the-art onsite Innovation Centre. 

## Releasing the passion to achieve the best in yourself 

At St. Paul's we always strive to be our better selves. We have the courage of our convictions, essential values, freedom to imagine and create.  This is achieved through our high quality British and Brazilian holistic education which drives the personal and academic development of pupils, within a framework of a caring, inclusive and united community. Our strong set of shared [values](/fs/pages/346) lie at the heart of the school, shaping the experience that our pupils enjoy. It is our aim to discover the passion and talents of every pupil.  

We recently launched our school's new promotional manifesto, that can watch in the link below. It sets out our school's vision and values to take us to our centenary in 2026. We hope you enjoy it!

## Why St. Paul's

We hope you will share our innovative educational outlook, aligned with modern social values and rooted in our British-Brazilian heritage
