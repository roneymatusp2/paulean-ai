St. Paul's School is a member of a number of national, regional and international organisations that allow the high educational standards we have set to be maintained. All these organisations offer support, training and opportunities to network with other British schools and remain current with respect to the British standards and educational developments.

In 2012 we became the first South American School to be formally recognised by the UK government as a British School Overseas. In December 2015 we were inspected again, and achieved excellence in many areas of school life, thus renewing our BSO accreditation. In 2019, there was a new inspection and we achieved excellence by meeting all the Standards for BSO.  Finally, in 2023, we had our latest inspection. To find out more you can read the full 2023 inspection report.

Brazilian pupils attending St. Paul's have the unique opportunity of being exposed to a curriculum comparable to other Brazilian schools, as well as learning in English. The school curriculum is designed with an integrated and transdisciplinary approach to subjects in order to offer a strong Portuguese and Brazilian Studies programme from Prep to Senior School. At the end of twelve successful years of education (ensino basico), pupils are entitled to receive their _Certificado de Conclus ao do Ensino Medio_, and are well prepared to continue their studies in Brazilian universities.
