At St. Paul's, we understand that our pupils need to learn about themselves, and from the ever-changing world in which they live. St. Paul's pupils receive a holistic education: we believe in helping our pupils achieve their full potential.

The wide range of clubs, societies, trips, visits, sporting, music and House activities we offer all enrich the vibrant Paulean learning experience. Our unique enrichment programme means that our pupils enjoy the finest learning experience; that reaches far beyond the classroom walls and prepares them for the diverse and dynamic world beyond school.

Sports 

Sport is an essential ingredient of our school's culture; it is embraced as an opportunity for growth, and for developing what we refer to as "quality Pauleans", pupils who develop personality traits that embody the school's values.

The Arts 

Whether through visual arts, drama, or film, at St. Paul's pupils are encouraged to express their creativity and learn about themselves.

## Clubs & Societies

Our expansive list of clubs and societies ranges from dance to astronomy, from knitting to robotics, from mathematics olympiads and debating societies to the Greenpower project, where our pupils design, build and race an electric car, representing the country internationallyl. We also offer extensive and well-renowned programmes in sports, music, and the arts.

Programmes like the MUN (Model United Nations) society exemplify the holistic education we offer our pupils. It is a fully pupil-led activity that provides a unique opportunity for pupils to develop their understanding of international current affairs, while honing their debating and public-speaking skills as they defend different countries' perspectives on mock UN committees.

St. Paul's is a strong advocate of the Duke of Edinburgh's International Award, a challenging programme which is available to all Pauleans aged 14-18\. It is a balanced, non-competitive programme of voluntary activities, which encourages personal discovery and growth, self-reliance, perseverance, responsibility to themselves and service to their community. Award-holders are recognised world-wide as people who have achieved something which lies above and beyond the usual academic qualifications.

## Houses

The house system at St. Paul's follows a quintessentially British tradition that teaches our pupils the value of teamwork, belonging, and striving to do our best . The house tradition at St. Paul's began in 1931. Today, St. Paul's has three houses - Stuart, Tudor and Windsor. Pupils remain in the same house throughout their time at St. Paul's and through the house system forge life-long friendships and learn vital life lessons.

Various activities occur throughout the year under the ethos of house spirit, in which pupils can earn points for their house. These include an annual athletics day (held on school premises for the Prep, and at the University of Sao Paulo for the Senior School), a house shout (a fun, motivational musical competition), and in the Prep School, a house day and several activities ranging from timetable competitions to general knowledge conundrums and "human tic-tac-toe" championships!

Each house is represented by pupil house captains who are chosen for their house spirit and dedication to applying the school's values. The house with the most points at the year-end wins the coveted house cup (or house spirit trophy in the Prep School).

## Trips and visits

Field trips also form an integral part of the curriculum with every year group from the age of nine taking part in residential visits throughout Brazil and beyond. St. Paul's pupils have the unique opportunity of putting their learning into practice during various compulsory and elective school trips.

In the Pre-Prep, pupils enjoy local outings that enhance their topic-based learning. In the Prep School, pupils visit museums, exhibitions, places linked directly to their studies and also have the chance to enjoy residential team-building camp experiences. In the Senior School. Meanwhile, there are field trips to Paraty to study local history and the coastline, history trips to Europe, geography trips to Boiçucanga, World Student trips to impoverished areas of Tanzania and India, and the IB visual arts pupils enjoy interactive art experiences in Inhotim.
