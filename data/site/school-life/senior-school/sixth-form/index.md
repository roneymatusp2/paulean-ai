## Leavers' destinations

St. Paul' s School leavers enroll into courses at college schools or universities around the world.  Here is a list of our pupils' destinations in the last five years.

Welcome to the Sixth Form at St. Paul's, a happy and challenging study environment for pupils aged 16 to 18.

Our sixth-formers are bright, independent learners and critical thinkers who leave the school well prepared for the challenges of higher education and the world of work, whether at home and abroad. Our curriculum, administered via the [IB Diploma Programme](https://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/), is academically rigorous and robust.

Examination results at St Paul's are invariably good, and often outstanding, which ensures that our pupils have opportunities to study at the most prestigious universities throughout the world. Pupils can choose from a wide range of subjects and have the opportunity to pursue their talents and specific interests in greater depth.

The Extended Essay, CAS (Creativity, Action and Service), and ToK (Theory of Knowledge) elements of the course are crucial in encouraging our pupils to analyse the world around them and to develop a world view that will stand them in good stead for the rest of their lives. 

To complement this academically challenging curriculum, and to provide sixth-formers with a truly holistic education, the school offers a unique PSHE (personal, social and health education) programme. This includes our own "how to" course where pupils are prepared for the practical challenges of adult life, from ironing shirts and sewing on buttons to financial planning. Every pupil is supported by a network of experienced pastoral staff.

Many of our sixth-formers have been at the school since entering the Pre-Prep at the age of three, and are eloquent, well-mannered, and hard-working individuals who care deeply about their friends and the world about them. When they leave us, they are inspired and equipped to make the world a better place.

## The Sixth Form Curriculum

In the Sixth Form, all pupils study for the full International Baccalaureate Diploma. The IB course is a rigorous and well-structured programme which provides a broad educational base that prepares young people for further study at leading universities and working life in the international environment.

The IB Diploma Programme is not just about teaching content - it teaches pupils how to learn, and provides them with the key values and opportunities they need to make wise choices in life. Through the IB diploma programme, St. Paul's develops pupils who:

  * have excellent breadth and depth of knowledge
  * flourish physically, intellectually, emotionally and ethically
  * study at least two languages
  * excel in traditional academic subjects
  * explore the nature of knowledge through the programme's unique Theory of Knowledge course.



Although the majority of our IB diploma graduates go on to study at leading universities abroad, some of our pupils go on to[ Brazilian universities that accept the IB results](/fs/pages/356), such as FGV, FIA and ESPM, which is a positive indication that international education is moving forwards in Brazil.

  * The IB Diploma Programme



## The IB Diploma Programme

The IB Diploma is a two-year course of study. All IB students take six subjects from different academic areas of which three are studied at higher and three at standard level.

All pupils must take English, Mathematics, and Portuguese, either at Standard or Higher Level. They choose from the following options:

To qualify for the IB Diploma award, a pupil must receive a combined score of 24 points across 6 subjects with at least 12 points from higher level subjects and a minimum of nine points from standard level subjects.
