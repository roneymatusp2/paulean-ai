The curriculum offered in the upper years is the [IGCSE ](https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/programmes-and-qualifications/cambridge-upper-secondary/cambridge-igcse/curriculum/)and [IB Diploma Programme](https://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/). These are rigorous academic curricula which are designed to challenge pupils intellectually.

We provide a broad and balanced curriculum in the Senior School; we teach skills, knowledge, concepts and attitudes in all curriculum areas, following carefully designed guidelines.

The curriculum offered at St. Paul's is intended to facilitate the successful transition to Senior School, develop academic independence and good study habits through a wide range of subjects, and prepare pupils for the demands of the international examination courses (IGCSE and IB).

## Subjects taught

  * Forms 1 and 2
  * Form 3
  * Forms 4 and 5



## Forms 1 and 2

  * English, Portuguese, Mathematics, Science, Geography, History, Historia, Geografia (both taught in Portuguese), Computer Studies (building on the ICT taught in Prep School), Art, Drama, Music and Physical Education (PE).

  * There is an emphasis on English, Portuguese, Mathematics and Science to which more time is devoted in the timetable, but we consider all subjects to be of equal importance in the provision of a balanced curriculum




## Form 3

The list is the same as the one above, however, instead of Science our pupils study the sciences separately: Biology, Chemistry, and Physics. In addition, they all study French.

## Forms 4 and 5

  * English Language 

  * English Literature 

  * Portuguese 

  * Mathematics 

  * Biology 

  * Chemistry

  * Physics

  * Coordinated Science 




They can also opt to study the following subjects: 

  * Global Perspectives 

  * Spanish 

  * French 

  * Computer Studies 

  * Geography 

  * History 




They must also choose one subject from the following list: 

  * IGCSE Music 

  * BTEC Music Technology 

  * IGCSE Art 

  * IGCSE Drama 

  * BTEC Creative Media Production 




They will continue to study Historia, Geografia and Physical Education.

Pupils also have one tutorial period per fortnight in which they follow a programme related to personal, social and health education (PSHE). They also have one period per fortnight dedicated to enrichment activities, where pupils can choose from a broad selection of co-curricular activities ranging from robotics to rugby, and from knitting to astronomy.

The IGCSE programme, offered by many international schools, gives solid foundation knowledge while improving pupils' critical thinking skills. It is also an excellent preparation for the International Baccalaureate course in the Sixth Form.

## Sixth Form

A happy and challenging study environment for pupils aged 16 to 18.
