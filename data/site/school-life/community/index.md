## Parent and Teacher Association (PTA)

The PTA plays an important role in the school community. The volunteer work of parents, teachers and staff members aims to foster a strong sense of school community, to enhance communication and understanding between school and parents, to enrich pupils' learning experiences, as well as to promote actions and fundraising events to support charities and other institutions in Brazil.

If you are a member of the St. Paul's community, please access the [PTA's page on My School Portal ](https://stpauls.myschoolportal.co.uk/forms/140#/formGroup)to find out more and participate in our activities, including details of how to volunteer and become a representative for your year group. To find out more about the work of the PTA, you can also write to us at [pta@stpauls.br.](mailto:pta.stpaulsbr@gmail.com)

### International Day

The PTA's flagship event is the highly popular International Day. This multicultural event is a celebration of the different nationalities and cultures in the St. Paul's community.  A large number of parents volunteer to manage country stands that represent cultural themes from across the world and hundreds of parents, children and visitors come to support the event.

Brands and companies play a central role in funding the event, to ensure all proceeds go to our charities. The event is an excellent opportunity to build on a brand or company's reputation, and to generate awareness among an audience that is always open to great quality products. If you are interested in becoming a sponsor, please contact us at [pta@stpauls.br.](mailto:pta.stpaulsbr@gmail.com) [You can also follow us on Instagram.](https://www.instagram.com/stpaulsinternationalday/)

### Charity and community service

Charity and community service are extremely important at St. Paul's School, as they teach our pupils compassion and empathy, that they are part of a larger community, and that we are responsible for everyone around us. Our strong programme of outreach activities make us more aware of the world we live in and teaches us to care for those less fortunate than ourselves. That knowledge and understanding, stays with us our whole life. A little help can go a long way.

These are just some of the institutions we are currently helping:

Fundação Britânica 

Mão Amiga 

We regularly visit the different institutions we work with and invite the children and adults from these to come and spend a morning, afternoon or a day at school. For example our Pre-Prep children enjoy playing with the Liga Solidaria children at their annual sports event, and the PP3 children take their class books to read to small children at the creches and invite groups of children to visit our playground. Prep 5 pupils visit the homes for the elderly supported by the British Society, and spend time playing games with them and listening to their stories. In the Senior School, pupils make regular visits to the Liga Solidaria creches where they offer practical help by washing and cleaning materials and toys, gardening and basic maintenance work. Sixth Form pupils also explore the importance of community service in more depth through their practical activities completed as a compulsory part of Creativity, Action and Service), one of the core subjects of the IB Diploma. Recent projects completed as part of the course have included fundraising and practical outreach work in some of the poorest districts of the outskirts of Sao Paulo as well as independent pupil projects as far away as Nepal.

Across all areas of the school, we collect items to donate, and money to buy Christmas and Easter presents.  We find different ways to raise money and awareness in order to help others feel loved.
