Form 4 Pupils explore Brasília: A journey through urban planning and civic responsibility 

Apr 17 2025

As part of the Brazilian Social Studies curriculum, our Form 4 pupils traveled to Brasilia

During the three-day trip, pupils got to visit different landmarks of the city and deepen their understanding of urban planning, government structure, and civic responsibility.

To start out the trip, pupils worked in groups to map the area, observe and evaluate its urban design, and interview local people.

At the National Congress, they learned about the structure and functioning of Brazil's legislative system. They explored how laws are created and discussed the importance of democratic processes in shaping the country's future.

During the visit to the Ministry of Regional Integration and Development, pupils discovered how the government monitors and responds to natural disasters. They learned about civil defence strategies, risk prevention, and the role of public institutions in supporting communities affected by extreme weather and other emergencies.

To conclude the trip, pupils visited the Brasilia Cathedral, the JK Memorial, and the TV Tower, where they had the chance to reflect on what they've learned while taking in a panoramic view of the city.

Our Form 4 pupil, Maria Alice, shared:

_" The most special moment was going up the TV Tower, where we enjoyed a panoramic view of Brasilia, revealing all the organisation and planning of the city that we had studied in class. In addition to the view, we met some interesting people who worked there._

_As young Brazilian citizens who are not yet very involved in politics -- due to factors such as the voting age -- this trip was an important opportunity to get closer to the political world. We were able to gain a better understanding of how laws work, the political environment, and, more broadly, reflect on citizenship in our own country."_
