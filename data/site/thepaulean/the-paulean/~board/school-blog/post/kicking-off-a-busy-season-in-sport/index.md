Kicking off a busy season in Sport 

Mar 26 2025

The sports season is in full swing, and our teams have been showing incredible dedication, determination, and competitive spirit in every match!

Varsity Girls Futsal and Varsity Girls Volleyball are having an outstanding, undefeated season and have already secured their spot in the grand final. Now, it's time to stay focused and bring another championship home!

Our Varsity Futsal Boys and Varsity Volleyball Boys fought bravely, delivering intense and well-balanced matches. Despite their great effort on the court, they, unfortunately, did not advance to the medal rounds.

 

**Junior Varsity in action!**

Our Junior Varsity teams, both in futsal and volleyball, are still in the middle of the season, with everything to play for in the standings:

**Volleyball:**

  * JV Girls are leading the group with two wins in two games!
  * JV Boys are in third place, with one win and one loss.



**Futsal:**

  * JV Girls are fighting for a spot in the next stage, with one win and one loss, currently in third place.
  * JV Boys continue to battle hard as they aim for their first win of the competition.



We are incredibly proud of our athletes, who give their all in every match! We count on our community's support in the upcoming fixtures to bring extra energy to our teams and help them achieve even more championships for St. Paul's!
