Junior School Pupils exploring beyond the classroom 

Mar 19 2025

At St. Paul's School, we believe trips are an amazing way to provide opportunities for our pupils to experience the curriculum through memorable, hands-on activities.

Our Pre-Prep 2s had a trip to the supermarket to buy fruits for their fruit salad. Before heading out, pupils created a shopping list, thinking carefully about what fruits would make a delicious combination. In the afternoon, they prepared the fruit salad and everyone took part in peeling, chopping, and mixing the fruits, using their fine motor skills and learning about food preparation. The children showed great teamwork and independence, carefully handling the utensils and helping one another.

In Prep School, our Prep 2s visited the Museu de Anatomia Veterinaria at USP to learn about animals and humans. They were amazed by the skeletons and body parts of various animals. The pupils had fun comparing these to human anatomy. 

Lastly, our Prep 3s had a great time at Rep Lago for a two-day residential trip. There, pupils worked on developing personal and social skills through sports, science, and geography activities, including water studies and sustainable waste management.
