SpsMUN 2025: St. Paul's School hosts its own MUN Conference 

Feb 28 2025

Delegates from multiple schools across Sao Paulo came to our campus for the SPsMUN - St. Paul's School Model United Nations.

Exercising their public speaking, debating and research skills, the pupils could have the chance to be diplomats representing a country. Therefore, they had to discuss problems and try to find agreement based on defending different cultures and points of view. 

In this year's edition, pupils debated about the internal Sudan crisis, women's rights in Afghanistan, nuclear energy as a solution for carbon emissions worldwide, and many other internationally relevant topics. 

Our pupil, Anna, who acted as Secretary General during this one's edition, shared that:

> "As Secretary General, I am proud to say SPsMUN 2025 was nothing short of extraordinary. With over 250 attendees from 10 different schools, this year's conference fostered thought-provoking debates, challenged global perspectives, and inspired innovative solutions to pressing international issues. Celebrating its 20th anniversary, this edition of SPsMUN brought together passionate students who embodied diplomacy, leadership, and the spirit of change. The success of the conference is a testament to the dedication of our Secretariat, chairs, admins, and delegates--proving once again that the voices of young leaders have the power to shape a better tomorrow."

We would like to congratulate the outstanding performance and commitment of St. Paul's pupils and staff during and before the event, it was a great MUN.
