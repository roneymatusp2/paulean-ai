Form 5 Pupils Begin Study Leave for IGCSE Exams 

Apr 14 2025

Last week, our Form 5 pupils officially began their study leave, marking the start of their preparation for the **IGCSE examinations** , which they will sit throughout May.

This moment also signifies the end of their journey in the Senior School. In August, these students will return to school as **Lower 6s**  and begin a new academic chapter: their **IB journey**.

To celebrate this milestone and say goodbye to their Senior School years, pupils signed each other's shirts and gathered to watch a heartfelt video message recorded by their teachers.

We also extend our best wishes to our **Upper 6 pupils** , who recently began their study leave for the **IB exams**. Good luck to all as they approach this crucial time with focus and determination!
