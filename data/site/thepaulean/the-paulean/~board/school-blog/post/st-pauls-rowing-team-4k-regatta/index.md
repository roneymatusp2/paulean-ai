St. Paul’s Rowing Team – 4K Regatta 

Apr 4 2025

#### by Mr Zsigmond, Outdoor Enrichment Coordinator

On Saturday, 29th March, the stunning rowing course at the University of Sao Paulo campus set the stage for the annual 4K festive regatta, bringing together over 170 boats in an exciting series of staggered starts.

Representing St. Paul's with great dedication and skill were two of our pupils, Giordano (L6) and Victor Leonardo (F4). Competing in the single scull category for their respective age groups, both rowers delivered exceptional performances, smashing their personal bests by over two minutes! Giordano completed the challenging 4K course in 21'08", while Victor followed closely with an impressive 21'54".

A huge congratulations to our incredible rowers for their hard work and fantastic achievements!

Below, they share their reflections on this unforgettable experience:

 

**Giordano**

_" Taking part in the 2025 4K Regatta at USP was a truly rewarding experience. The rowing community at USP radiates vivacity, and that was evident on that day. From the moment you get there, you see everyone's excited while they prepare themselves for the race. The whole experience puts everything you've learned into practice. All the technique, strategy, and commitment you've put into it over the years comes into play - and you simply feel happy with what you've achieved."_

 

**Victor Leonardo**

_" Competing in a rowing race was tough but exciting. The training had been hard, but the real challenge was the race itself. Every stroke needed full focus and energy, even when my arms felt like giving up. The sound of the water, the cheering crowd, and  the environment made it an amazing experience. No matter the result, I felt proud of what we had done." _
