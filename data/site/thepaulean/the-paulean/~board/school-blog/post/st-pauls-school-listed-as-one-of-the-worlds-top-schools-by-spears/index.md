St. Paul's School Recognised in the Spear's Schools Index Among the Best in the World 

Mar 14 2025

Spear's, a leading British publication in finance and lifestyle, has curated the [Spear's Schools Index](https://spearswms.com/education/best-private-schools-in-world-spears/), spotlighting private schools that excel in both academic brilliance and holistic student development.

St. Paul's School has earned a coveted spot on Spear's renowned list of the world's top schools. This recognition celebrates the school's exceptional curriculum and its dedication to nurturing well-rounded young learners.

We were recognised for our vibrant and stimulating learning environment, preparing students to excel at some of the world's most prestigious universities.

The index covers schools from various countries, recognised for their innovative curricula, state-of-the-art facilities, and highly qualified faculty.

"The inclusion of the school on the Spear's list reinforces Brazil's role in the global education landscape but also highlights our multidisciplinary work in the development of our students," says the school's headmaster, Titus Edge.
