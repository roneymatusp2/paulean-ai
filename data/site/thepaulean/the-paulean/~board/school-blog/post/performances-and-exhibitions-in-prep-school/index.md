Lively month in Junior School School: Performances and Exhibitions 

Apr 14 2025

The last month has been a lively one in the Junior School, filled with performances and exhibitions that gave pupils the chance to showcase their learning and creativity to parents. 

Our Pre-Prep 2s delivered a performance called 'There's a Sunflower on my Supper' \- a retelling of the story Daisy the Cow and her dream of having more than just grass to eat at her farm.

In Prep 1, pupils delighted the audience with a charming performance of Wackadoo Zoo, a musical set in a very unusual zoo. Prep 2 and 3 pupils also took to the stage, presenting performances inspired by books they've read this year. Prep 2s brought Captain Cat to life, tying in with their 'Adventure' theme, while Prep 3s performed Varjak Paw, linked to their theme of 'Discovery'.

Pupils spent time learning lines, rehearsing scenes, and perfecting the songs to be performed with a lot of enthusiasm and pride.

Rather than performing, Prep 4 and 5 pupils worked on exhibitions, allowing parents to explore their learning in creative and meaningful ways. 

Prep 4s designed a Human Museum, where they became living statues, each representing a different story of immigration--a key theme from their term's studies. Pupils also interviewed members of staff from across the school, including members of the Sodexo team, and shared these diverse life stories in a moving and thought-provoking exhibition.
