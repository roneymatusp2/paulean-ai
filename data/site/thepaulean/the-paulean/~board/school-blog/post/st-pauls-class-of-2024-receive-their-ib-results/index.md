St. Paul’s Class of 2024 receive their IB results 

Jul 10 2024

This week, together with over 192,000 other pupils across the globe, our Upper Sixth leavers (Class of 2024) celebrate their excellent results in the [International Baccalaureate](https://www.ibo.org/) Diploma Programme.

This year's cohort of boys and girls have done brilliantly with a 100% pass rate and 75 pupils achieving the diploma. The average points score of St. Paul's pupils is 35.4 points, compared with 34.7 last year. The global average is 30.32 points.

Around 22% of the individual grades were 7 and we are especially proud of our 18 high fliers who scored 40 or more points from a maximum of 45. Across the board the results were excellent.  The top score in each subject is 7 and some subjects have done exceptionally well with very high proportions of 6 and 7 grades. They all deserve special congratulations for their efforts and success.

"They are now set for university and life beyond. They should be proud of all they have achieved in their two-year diploma programme of study. We are delighted with the successes of this year's young men and women and are especially pleased that they have secured places at the finest universities around the world", says Titus Edge, St. Paul's Headmaster.

As they prepare to head off to university whether at home or overseas, we congratulate the pupils and their teachers most warmly on this excellent set of results and we wish them every success and happiness for the future.
