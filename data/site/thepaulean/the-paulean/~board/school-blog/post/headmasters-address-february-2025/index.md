Headmaster's Address | February 2025 

Feb 28 2025

As we embark on a new term, I would like to extend a warm welcome to all members of our community. We look forward to the exciting opportunities and experiences that lie ahead in the coming months.

February has been filled with exciting developments and enriching experiences for our pupils and staff alike.

Firstly, I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to our dedicated support teams who worked tirelessly during the holidays to refurbish our Senior School facilities. Their efforts have brought new classrooms and spaces for our pupils to thrive in. We are particularly proud to unveil our brand new and expanded hard courts, which you can watch in the video in this edition of The Paulean.

I'm proud to see the school community embracing the spirit of the Random Acts of Kindness Day. It was a heartwarming day that reminded us of the importance of kindness in our community.

Our P5 pupils embarked on their last residential trip as members of the Prep School. I'm sure it was a memorable experience that they will cherish as they transition to the next stage of their education.

Our participation in The Hague International Model United Nations (THIMUN) was another highlight of the month. This prestigious event attracts over 3,200 students and teachers from around the globe, providing our pupils with the opportunity to practice diplomacy in a truly international setting.

We are also thrilled to introduce our new prefect cohort for 2025-26. These pupils play a vital role in our school community, leading by example, fostering inclusivity, and inspiring their peers. You can meet them by clicking on the link below.

Lastly, we were honoured to welcome universities and various professionals who shared insights into their careers, spanning industries such as Health, Finance, the Arts, and more. These interactions have provided our pupils with valuable guidance as they consider their future paths.

Thank you for your continued support and engagement with our school community. I look forward to sharing more exciting updates with you in the coming months.
