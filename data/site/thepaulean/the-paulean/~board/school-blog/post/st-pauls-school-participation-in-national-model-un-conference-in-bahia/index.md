St. Paul's School participation in national Model UN Conference in Bahia 

Mar 24 2025

Brazil Model United Nations (BRAMUN) conference is one of the most prestigious and time-honoured events of this type in Latin America. Around 300 pupils from over 15 schools across Brazil converge on Costa do Sauipe, Bahia, to try and find solutions to some of the most pressing problems in the world today.

Our delegates actively debated topics of global significance, and our chairs conducted the debates in a diplomatic and professional manner.

A special shout-out to our Lower 6th pupils, who worked as real role models, showcasing true Paulean commitment and hard work and to Vittoria who won the Best Speaker Award!
