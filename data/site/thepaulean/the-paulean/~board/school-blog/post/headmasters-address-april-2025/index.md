Headmaster's Address | April 2025 

Apr 24 2025

As we move into the final half-term of the academic year, I find myself reflecting on the many vibrant and meaningful moments that have taken place across the school over recent weeks.

This time of year always brings a certain poignancy as we wish our Form 5 and Upper Sixth pupils the very best as they begin their study leave and prepare for the challenges of their IGCSE and IB examinations. 

Meanwhile, the rest of the school has been alive with colour, creativity and community spirit. Reading Week once again took over the campus in the best possible way, with pupils and staff arriving in costume to celebrate the joy of stories and the power of imagination. Our halls echoed with conversations with visiting authors who reminded us of the lasting impact that books can have. 

Creativity was also at the forefront in the Junior School, where many pupils delivered performances and exhibitions to share what they've been learning with their families. They brought their curriculum to life in wonderfully imaginative ways. 

We've also seen exciting strides in our commitment to sustainability. Landscape architect Rodrigo Cardim joined us to help redesign our green spaces, leading a collaborative project in which every year group, from our youngest to our oldest pupils, planted a native Brazilian tree. This initiative not only makes our campus more green but serves as an important reminder of our individual environmental responsibility -- particularly timely as we celebrated Earth Day this week.

In another sustainability-focused effort, our "Eco-Warriors" -- a group of pupils dedicated to exploring how we can make our school greener -- visited NGO IPÃŠ to witness the tangible impact of our school's composting project. 

It's been an exciting half-term and we look forward to seeing what else our pupils achieve during the next couple of months.
