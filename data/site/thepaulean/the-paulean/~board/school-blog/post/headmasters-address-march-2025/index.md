Headmaster's address | March 2025 

Mar 27 2025

Is it me, or are we finally witnessing the change of seasons? The mornings feel a little darker, the days a touch more clement - and dare we hope the worst of the thunderstorms are behind us (famous last words...)?

I've always enjoyed this time of year. Spring in England and autumn in Brazil each show their countries at their seasonal best. And as this edition of _The Paulean_  demonstrates, we are seeing St. Paul's at its best too.

While our Upper 6 and Form 5 pupils prepare for their upcoming IB and IGCSE exams, pupils of all ages have thrown themselves (sometimes quite literally) into the life of the school. From the extraordinary energy of Pre-Prep Sports Day to outstanding achievements in Senior School sport, there's been no shortage of spirit. Maths and Science Week saw intellectual, experimental - and even sartorial - flair on full display, and pupils from across the school have been out on enriching trips, including a Prep residential to Rep Lago and our Senior MUN team proudly representing us in Bahia.

Reading about all this and more, it's easy to see why St. Paul's is held in such pride and affection across our community. It's been a joy to welcome back Old Pauleans reflecting on their early schooldays in the Junior School - and I do hope many of you will join us for the Funda√ßao Quiz Night on 9th April.

What a lovely time of year - and what a lovely school we share. And if you happen to check the Spear's School Index for 2025, you'll spot St. Paul's ranked among the world's top 100 - the only school in Brazil to make the list!

Thank you, as ever, for your support - and enjoy another action-packed edition of _The Paulean_.
