Upper 6 oral presentation to Lower 6s about Extended Essay 

Mar 27 2025

As Lower 6 pupils embark on their Extended Essay journey, they had the opportunity to learn from those who have recently completed the process. Upper 6 pupils presented their Extended Essays, sharing insights into their research topics, challenges, and key takeaways.

The Extended Essay is a core component of the IB Diploma Programme, requiring students to undertake an independent research project in a subject of their choice. Beyond academic skills, it fosters critical thinking, discipline, and a deeper understanding of a topic students are passionate about.

Opportunities like this not only help demystify the process for younger pupils but also encourage a culture of academic mentorship within the school. We look forward to seeing how Lower 6 pupils develop their ideas over the coming months!
