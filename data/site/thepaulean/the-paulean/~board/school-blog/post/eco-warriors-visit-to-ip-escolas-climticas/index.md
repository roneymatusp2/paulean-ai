Eco Warriors Visit NGO IPÊ: Promoting Sustainable Practices 

Apr 18 2025

A selected group of pupils from the Junior and Senior school visited an innovative initiative that involves donating the fertiliser generated by our school's composter machine to an NGO focused on sustainable practices.

These pupils are part of our **Eco Warriors team** --a group of students dedicated to sustainability initiatives and making our school greener.

On March 31st, pupils had the chance to visit the **NGO IP Ê (Institute for Ecological Research)** in Nazare Paulista. Today, IPÊ is considered one of the largest environmental NGOs in Brazil and holds the OSCIP title. The group delivered a donation of fertiliser produced by the school's composting system!

This pupil-led initiative helps pupils develop leadership and organisational skills, alongside building knowledge on sustainable practices.
