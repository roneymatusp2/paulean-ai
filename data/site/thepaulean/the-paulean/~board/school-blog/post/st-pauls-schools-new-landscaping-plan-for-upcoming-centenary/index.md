St. Paul's School's new landscaping plan for upcoming Centenary 

Apr 21 2025

As part of St. Paul's centenary commitment to sustainability and the re-greening of our school, we are proud to be working with renowned Brazilian botanist and landscaper Ricardo Cardim on a transformative new landscaping project at the school.  
  
Over the past few weeks, Ricardo has been engaging with our pupils across all year groups -- from PP1 to Upper 6 -- to share the vision and ecological importance behind our new green spaces, all of which feature native Brazilian plant species.

ccompanied by gardeners, the children brought a piece of the Atlantic Rainforest back to St. Paul's.

This has been a powerful learning experience, deepening our students' understanding of biodiversity, conservation, and their role in protecting the environment.
