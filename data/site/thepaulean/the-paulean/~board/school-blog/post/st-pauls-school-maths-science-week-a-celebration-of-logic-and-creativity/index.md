St. Paul's School Maths & Science Week: a celebration of logic and creativity! 

Mar 17 2025

In celebration of Pi Day (March 14th), our pupils engaged in an exciting Maths and Science Week, filled with related activities across all year groups.

Junior School pupils explored STEAM-related activities both in the classroom and during break time, making learning fun and interactive.

Senior pupils took part in a thrilling chess competition, which culminated in an exciting final--congratulations to Antenor (Form 5) for securing 1st place, and Maite (Form 2) for finishing in 2nd.

In the Mental Maths Competition, pupils first competed within their year groups before the top three advanced to the final. A huge well done to Julia, Luc and Gabriela, who claimed 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place respectively.

Throughout the week, lunchtime was buzzing with hands-on biology, chemistry, geometry, and art activities, allowing pupils to dive deeper into the wonders of science and mathematics.

Prep 5 pupils got a glimpse of Senior School life with special taster Maths sessions, while Form 5s had an introduction to their future IB lessons.

Even parents joined in! Our Maths leaders and teachers hosted special workshops, sharing insights into how Maths is taught in Junior School and providing useful tips to support children's learning at home.

To wrap up the week, our PP3 to Prep 5 pupils embraced their creativity and dressed up as scientists, engineers, artists, or mathematicians, bringing the spirit of STEAM to life!

A huge thank you to all the pupils, teachers, and parents who made this week such a success. We can't wait for next year!
