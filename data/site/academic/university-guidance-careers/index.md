Pupils in the Senior School, and especially in the [Sixth Form](/fs/pages/434), take part in a full programme of activities to prepare them for applications to universities and for life beyond St. Paul's. The programme includes lectures, workshops, talks by former pupils, as well as individual assessment and career guidance provided by the tried and tested Morrisby Psychometric Testing.

When they complete the secondary stage of their education, Pauleans leave the school fully prepared for the challenges of further study.

Pupils have the opportunity to attend practice for the ACT (American College Testing) and SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test) examinations on Saturdays, to help them prepare to enter top universities. There is also one period in their timetable dedicated to university guidance, where representatives of leading British, American, European and Canadian universities provide advice on the vast available array of courses and their application procedures. Every year there are two university and professional guidance fairs where pupils can speak personally to directors of admissions. This all allows our pupils to make informed and fitting decisions about their futures.

Our School Profile highlights further information on the school, its pupils and exams' results. Click on the link below to read it.
