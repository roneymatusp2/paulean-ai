At St. Paul's, we believe technology brings unmeasurable benefits to pupils as  21st century learners who will make a positive impact beyond school. We are proud of embracing the latest in educational technology.  

Our teachers and leadership ensure that technology is purposefully integrated into the curriculum to add value to every pupil's learning experiences. By encouraging digital literacy at a young age among our pupils, we hope to expose them to all the benefits of digital learning. Technology is used in meaningful ways, to develop pupils as empowered learners, and creative communicators. For its excellent use of technology in education, St. Paul's is recognised as an [Apple Distinguished School ](/fs/pages/454)and a [Microsoft Showcase School ](https://youtu.be/Cv-WcTFPtuc)since 2018.  

Everyday immersion in technology is supported through a 1:2 iPad programme for children in Prep 1 and 2, a 1:2 iPad programme for Prep 3, 4 and 5, and a BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) programme for Senior School pupils. To encourage collaborative and personalised learning, we also use the Microsoft Office 365 suite for all staff and pupils. All file sharing is cloud-based, so pupils and teachers benefit from the "anytime, anyplace" learning opportunities. Classrooms are set up with interactive whiteboards and Apple TVs. There is also a creative space where pupils can get hands-on experience with 3D design, robotics and carving machines.  

The security of this network and the e-safety of our pupils and staff is also a  priority, and the necessary steps have been taken to ensure the highest standards are in place. Our IT team ensures that we have a fast, secure and monitored network and as an educational institution, we are committed to helping pupils navigate  negative aspects of the online world such as cyberbullying, plagiarism and invasion of privacy.   

Our Digital Learning strategy has touched every aspect of the school. Nowadays, teacher's interaction with technology is very natural, as they use their devices and all digital resources to various things - to register attendance, to research new materials, to prepare and post resources on the virtual learning environment or in the pupils' digital journal, to assign tasks, to give feedback, to use the behaviour registration system, and to communicate with pupils.  

We always aim for pupils to use technology in an active way to story, experiment, create and as a stimulus to inspire talk and collaboration. Teachers use technology to enhance children's learning for example through projects that result in animation, photo galleries, short films, electronic books and much more.   

## 78%

of teachers across school believe technology improved their practice and their pupils' performance.

## 93%

of senior school pupils believe their lessons have become more dynamic and creative since they started using their devices at school.

We were delighted to received in 2021 the prestigious Microsoft Showcase School badge in recognition for our excellence in transforming and enhancing the learning environment to deliver more personalised education to its pupils.

## Learning tools

At St. Paul's, the Digital Learning team has established a partnership with the Learning Support Unit, to explore together with the pupils how technology can help them to learn and express their ideas. They have selected apps and software to help them develop their productivity, organisation, reading and writing to help them be more independent in their learning.

## Digital leaders

To ensure that St. Paul's School is kept modern and up to date with today's rapidly evolving technology, the school has a group of digital leaders, formed of pupils from the Senior and Prep School. Their work is focused on:

  * testing software and apps before we roll them out to teachers and pupils
  * advocating for the safe and responsible use of digital devices and resources
  * offering support for pupils who had difficulties embarking on the digital journey 
  * helping us to learn about pupils' concerns and needs.
