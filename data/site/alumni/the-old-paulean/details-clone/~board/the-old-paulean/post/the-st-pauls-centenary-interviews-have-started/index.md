# The St. Paul's Centenary interviews have started

The St. Paul's Centenary interviews have started 

Feb 28 2024

As our 100th anniversary approaches, we are already working on recollecting the school's history. To rebuild our timeline precisely, we are digging into the Paulean's historical files and searching about the important events which are fundamental for our history, such as the British immigration to Brazil. 

Although the archives and libraries are essential for the project, there is another crucial element to this research: our community. Therefore, we chose a very special date to start interviewing some members of our community, the day 27th of February, our 98th anniversary. 

The first two Pauleans to share their memories with us were Mr William Anderson, who attended St. Paul's from 1946 to 1953, and Mrs Rosalind Barnes, who used to be a pupil in the '50s, a teacher after that, a mother of Pauleans and now a grandmother of Pauleans. 

It was a nice moment, filled with the lion's pride and the sense of belonging. We hope to be sharing more about this project soon. If you have any items from your time at St. Paul's to share, please send us a message at oldpauleansociety@stpauls.br
