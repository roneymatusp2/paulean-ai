# Paulean AI - Final Setup Instructions

## Project Overview
Paulean AI is now complete and ready for deployment. The application consists of:
- React/TypeScript frontend with voice capabilities
- Supabase Edge Functions backend
- Static mirror of St. Paul's website
- Beautiful floating action button interface

## Environment Setup

1. Create a `.env` file from the template:
```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

2. Verify the contents of `.env`:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_FUNCTIONS_URL=https://gjvtncdjcslnkfctqnfy.supabase.co/functions/v1
```

## Installing Static Mirror

Copy the mirror to the public directory:
```bash
xcopy /E /I /Y C:\Users\roney\WebstormProjects\paulean-ai\stpauls_mirror\www.stpauls.br C:\Users\roney\WebstormProjects\paulean-ai\public\stpauls_site_mirror
```

## Running the Application

1. Install dependencies (if needed):
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment to Netlify/Vercel

## Testing the Application

1. Click the floating Paulean AI button in the bottom-right corner
2. Type a question about St. Paul's School
3. Test voice input by clicking the Record button
4. Test voice output by clicking the Play button on AI responses
5. Click source links to verify they open the mirrored site

## Troubleshooting

### If build fails:
- Ensure TypeScript errors are resolved
- Check that all dependencies are installed
- Verify environment variables are set

### If API calls fail:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify CORS is working correctly
- Ensure Supabase Edge Functions are deployed
- Check your internet connection

### If voice features don't work:
- Ensure browser supports Web Speech API
- Check microphone permissions
- Verify HTTPS is being used (required for mic access)

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to production (Netlify/Vercel)
2. Update CORS settings in Edge Functions for production domain
3. Consider adding analytics
4. Monitor error logs and user feedback

## Support

For issues, check:
- Browser console for errors
- Network tab for API responses
- Supabase dashboard for Edge Function logs

The application is now ready for production deployment!
