# Paulean AI - Mirror Links Solution

## The Problem
Sources in the AI chat were not linking to the local mirror at `/stpauls_site_mirror/`

## The Solution

### 1. Fixed URL Transformation Logic
- Updated `getLinkForMirroredSite()` in `/src/utils/getLinkForMirroredSite.ts`
- Now correctly transforms URLs like:
  - `https://www.stpauls.br/about-us` → `/stpauls_site_mirror/about-us.html`
  - `https://www.stpauls.br/` → `/stpauls_site_mirror/index.html`

### 2. Enhanced PauleanChat Component
- Shows both original and mirror URLs in source links
- Added debug logging for link clicks
- Styled links to be more visible and clickable

### 3. Added Environment Variable Handling
- Created fallback values to prevent errors
- Added `.env` file with placeholders
- Better error messages for missing configuration

### 4. Created Debug Tools
- `DebugUrlTransformations`: Tests URL mapping logic
- `TestMirrorLinks`: Simulates AI responses with sources
- PowerShell script to verify mirror structure

## How to Test

1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Open chat and ask any question
3. Click on source links - they should navigate to `/stpauls_site_mirror/`
4. Check browser console for transformation logs

## Files Modified

1. `/src/utils/getLinkForMirroredSite.ts` - Core transformation logic
2. `/src/components/PauleanChat.tsx` - Updated link rendering
3. `/src/services/supabaseApi.ts` - Added mock responses and error handling
4. `/src/components/PauleanChat.css` - Improved link styling

## Next Steps

1. Remove debug components when confirmed working
2. Set real Supabase credentials in `.env`
3. Deploy to production
