# Mirror Link Fix Summary

## Issue
The Paulean AI chat was not linking to the local mirror at `/stpauls_site_mirror/` as intended.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Environment Variables
- Added placeholder values to prevent "Missing Supabase environment variables" errors
- Created `.env` file with example values
- Added better error handling with fallback values

### 2. URL Transformation
- Updated `getLinkForMirroredSite()` function to match actual mirror structure
- Mirror uses `.html` files at root level (e.g., `about-us.html`)
- Not using subdirectory index files (e.g., `about-us/index.html`)

### 3. PauleanChat Component
- Updated source links to show both original and mirror URLs
- Added debug logging on link clicks
- Changed navigation to use local mirror paths
- Added visual indicators showing mirror URLs

### 4. Debug Tools
- Created `DebugUrlTransformations` component to test URL mapping
- Created `TestMirrorLinks` component to simulate AI responses
- Added PowerShell script to verify mirror structure

## How It Works Now

1. When AI returns sources like `https://www.stpauls.br/about-us`
2. The `getLinkForMirroredSite()` transforms it to `/stpauls_site_mirror/about-us.html`
3. Links navigate to the local mirror instead of external site
4. Debug info shows both original and transformed URLs

## Testing

1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Look for the debug panels below the hero section
3. Click on source links in the chat to see they navigate to mirror
4. Check console logs for transformation details

## Next Steps

1. Remove debug components once verified working
2. Configure real Supabase credentials in `.env`
3. Deploy to production with proper environment variables
